 Yeah hello hello yeah hi this is uh uh rear areas. My ass is speaking. Yeah it's it's boldness. I'm not even sure if it makes sense for us to talk. It just looks like you were looking at some possible programs like the Fresh Start program to resolve your tax debt with the IRS. That's true. Yeah.
 Okay okay well I just had some time to give you a call and I just kind of wanted to see what was going on if you've already taken care of that or are you still trying to resolve that.
 What's going on? Can you look into it for me and let me know what it is really going on because it's technically, it's technically two different people tax debt. It's my ex, my, my spouse, my ex spouse.
 Due to, I would be able to claim my taxes together because you were together for six longer than six months so we were come along married.
 Me and him have departed but every season doing it taxes since 2021 is this a red flag and I'm not sure why.
 It's a man does his taxes every year why he owes them anything. So that's what I was trying to figure out because I was also on his taxes.
 I have all of his information but my thing is for someone to be taken for all the years that he's worked and have to hold the state is something wrong with that he's never missed the time on his text or anything like that.
 So I was trying to look into it for him is including because I was on it with him.
 If anyone owed anything.
 At first they were trying to say is about our kids.
 But we already said that in the bud like he got all the paperwork that they needed. They still was giving us a run around what it really was.
 I think it was filling money from him and then they read like it or whatever the case may be he didn't get tested at all.
 So I'm not sure what it is. Then this last year we have out together again and they didn't give him anything because they were going to give him anything but they actually added up.
 They actually put his debt higher than what the fuck is supposed to be in.
 And in reality I don't think he needs to be on anything if he paid his taxes every year.
 Well how do you know if he's been getting any letters in the mail from the IRS because of that.
 He only got two he only got two to three letters.
 One of them was like for 28 something and he went down to 18 something and then he went down to six something.
 Then it went down to eight something and then now they're saying that he owes the whole vaccine and I don't know.
 It doesn't make sense for any anybody that works you know what I mean and they do their taxes every year.
 It should be no reason why this man owes money if I'm trying to understand I don't get it.
 Yeah of course.
 Or if it was because when my first child my first child is not his child.
 But I wrote letters stating that he is able to claim my trial only because he had my child since one month.
 You know what I mean.
 So he's raised all the kids that we have.
 He's raised them the first and the last and it's not his with the input.
 And I did all the paperwork saying that he's able to claim you know the certain authority because he's raising them.
 You know he's money into them.
 The man that buys and you know do rent you know and all that good stuff.
 So I wrote that down I did all of that every year.
 So I still not understand why every time he goes to someone in the house and the more I would they give him the run around they don't give him straight answers like for instance for me when I was when I had to do when I had the old.
 So I'm not asking way way back they gave me where my son went for him they have not said it not one thing over here somewhere and then they only did that one year for me.
 So after that year I haven't seen what said that I owe anything but they're still saying that I'm.
 I'm going something with him being me and being on it together on the inside but I would still get everything for I made sure this year.
 So after everything as it is styles I make sure that all his stuff everything that goes to his time card nothing okay but they have not gave him any paperwork saying what's going on they have not explained anything to this man and I call and I try to figure out what's going on because
 it's like obviously he doesn't give him a run around because he obviously don't know what's going on but like me there's been a little bit experienced in understanding of what's going on.
 I understand that it shouldn't be going on so I want to get to the bottom of it even though if I'm there with him or not on half of his you know taxes so I am able to speak with them you know what I need so.
 Yeah of course it's been they've been doing something I don't know what the heck are you doing all I know is they need to give him this money back.
 Well your type of situation is taken care of it's his type of situation that's in the dark.
 Yeah so pretty much I want to end your spouse with the injured spouse and I'm injured because I was not able I'm not able to work my my I'm going to try to get disability because my doctor even took my license so I've been trying to not work but when I do work I put it I know I put we put all our stuff together and we do it together.
 So obviously I'm the injured spouse.
 So what they expected to him this year when he went to death if you just in here this year.
 They gave us take away the people that we really eat our tea in on paper to everything and gave them everything they needed and they still said that he opened with no explanation with no nothing.
 I know anything that I know for me in the state of Iowa I owe them a bear.
 Do you know if you know.
 Around $8,000 right I will owe the $8,000 but he's already that's big they already took that.
 Well are you guys filing separately or you guys filing jointly.
 No we have we've already found one last year.
 Okay. Okay so join the okay that's good so that means some you know that we could be able to take kill two birds one stone in that case.
 Yeah and why don't we do this then.
 Okay so before we get into who we are and what we do and our company and everything it might be appropriate if I ask you a few questions first just to see if I can even help you out because I mean.
 Okay you might might not even need us and there might not even be anything we could do so it really just depends.
 So yeah so we'll just start off by telling me a little bit about you guys in situation.
 So right now you said you had like $8,000 that you will stay a bio of correct.
 That's for me. Yes, but they have his stuff and like 20,000 to 30.
 20,000 to 30.
 Okay, I think I haven't seen that I don't have the paperwork in front of me from just you know.
 Yeah that's fine that's fine. So would you say stay your federal.
 Shoot.
 That's fine if you don't if you don't know it's fine.
 Yeah actually is there any way. How about you give me a call.
 Can I call you back Friday when I get my back paperwork bin.
 Well that's not necessary we don't really need it right now.
 I'm just going to ask you a few basic questions.
 But if you'd like I mean was your house is there any time you and your husband could both kind of be there.
 I could always call him on on free way of their time.
 Okay that's fine yeah anything.
 Yeah that would work too.
 We close up five Pacific standard time.
 Okay, so I will have to do a Monday we're going to do a Monday with him because he's awful work on Monday.
 Okay I think you two have been talking about this already right getting this issue resolved.
 Yeah yeah yeah we've been all of it we've been trying to find anybody and I want to help us out with it as well too so.
 Yeah well since I have you on the phone now we could at least see what it is we could even do for you now.
 And if everything makes sense we could talk about possible next steps.
 Would that help you.
 Yes that would be fine.
 Okay so right now you said you're not sure if it's like a personal or a state issue you feel like it could be maybe a little bit of both as well correct.
 Yeah okay.
 Okay that's fine and.
 As the IRS you said they had they have been taking actions on you right there.
 They're charging out these easier assets or bank accounts regardless of any wages.
 No they haven't they haven't done any of that.
 That's why I'm confused on how he's an owner if he does if they did.
 If he didn't owe this amount for how many odd years.
 Then they would have been garnished in his book.
 Yeah of course.
 It's what I was it's it's understanding I will get you know.
 Yeah but they're sending you letters that you that knows right.
 And they didn't even send a letter we call we had to call it that didn't send them out like that's why I'm like.
 You know we don't have none of that work that you guys were talking about.
 Can you get it to us like and it took a month to even do that.
 Yeah that they just move really slowly when it comes to these kind of things because that's how they make the most money you know so they're only doing it so they could get the most out of us.
 Well okay well since these are hardship programs the first start programs.
 It's really the best way to qualify for a better program is really determined by your hardship and how the situation has affected you.
 So what I'm going to do here is I'm just kind of get an idea of what your situation.
 Well I can for me I am homeless.
 I need to hear that.
 So, I don't have any like income or no like they're like I said, my doctor even put my license to my health so I'm trying to figure out which is my daughter as it is.
 And I have five, I have five kids so it's a lot for me on top of top of the figure out where he where I need in order to survive in the kids and all that.
 Where are you, where are you guys all staying at then.
 You don't want me asking.
 for me and I got to read all we say in Rome when we can if I have the money for
 it for the other kids they actually stay with him and Terry I was so okay so you
 two are no longer together that's what it sounds like
 you're still there there is I think I lost you there you said what yeah we're
 you choose no longer together then no we're so no we're not together anymore as
 you speak right now okay but that's according to the IRS according to the IRS
 you are yes we found because we say in the state of Iowa they if you say we
 tell the following six months I mean him having several relationships so we were
 able to put the child link together because of that but we recently had just
 broke up so it's not like it happened years ago you know I mean so we're not
 doing anything you know that's illegal that's another reason why I always have
 conversation with people as well because I have to make sure they know you know
 this is not no scam or nothing like that we don't play in type of games don't
 play with government like that I don't need one so with that you said yeah we
 literally we literally just stopped being at this year so last year's tax is
 perfectly fine okay here yeah okay so I'm I'm sorry I believe I have your name
 as Ares the real Ares Queen but what is that that's my nickname okay yeah I'll
 like yeah okay Sierra alright CIE with a T-T-S-T-I-E okay TIE R-A-R-I-A okay
 Sierra yeah yep and then you know and then it's Johnson Calvin my name is
 hyphenated okay so it's nobody has the same name so yeah it's the first time I
 heard a name like that it is really unique yeah so you said Sierra Calvin
 Johnson and that's your first name or is that your Johnson's your middle name
 and Calvin's your last name no I have two last names okay I have five names all
 together so I have yeah my sister has my sister has a huge name believe it or
 not my sister name is an A-DAP presios a princess I'm also kind of gorgeous that's
 my sister's name can you believe that no that's a lot I'm actually yeah I got a
 lot of yeah that's my mom just that was the first girl she had and she went
 crazy and she just gave her all the names that she could have given all her
 so yeah I hear you I mean when sometimes it's like that okay well anyway um first
 off here uh you know you said you didn't really know how this came about like
 didn't feel like maybe this is this is this is what I understood so when me and
 got together this was probably just a year or so after my son was born he didn't
 have a problem we didn't have problems doing our taxes separately doing
 perfectly fine with that that next year I had him claim my son because I no
 longer had a doctor so I had a pregnancy so I had him claim my son no problem no
 problem the whole time right so once we get to this on 62nd and the moist I
 will it was it was um his aunt who did it now anybody else in the family they're
 done anybody that in its family has done uh his uh we had one person that was
 doing his taxes um and um okay have um doing this taxes and it was the
 cousin you know problem you know everybody got and they have all our
 paperwork and she had that for years no problem well one year he let him do
 it and he said he said your back nothing nothing came back at all yeah so it was
 missing like maybe the filing something went wrong in the filing then so it
 sounds like yeah I don't know what she did I really think she took his money I'm
 not gonna lie yeah okay she might have caught you in this situation then this
 is what I'm saying so anybody that done his taxes has gave him paperwork has
 gave him paperwork has shown him what what happened with the paperwork has
 emailed the paperwork anytime I asked her call when it comes to this lady she
 can't find nothing that's so weird that she spent through the tax people but
 she don't know the number so every year that she's done this the list of
 oh okay so I think it hurts he's still don't think it is and okay well how long
 are you even dealing with this whole issue for it here like the whole tax
 issue you know it's 2020 I believe oh no more years
 uh-huh yes and he has the big impact and and has that an impact on you throughout
 the whole time for me yeah I'm here of course it had an impact on him because
 at one point he couldn't find a place and there's a lot you said he couldn't
 find a place I'm sorry I didn't get that he couldn't find it he couldn't find a
 place he wasn't able to find one to ask the kid do something about the money kids
 do not have one able to get like certain things that they needed to fight with
 my economy so they you know start stuff like that so yes it doesn't have a
 poker and and how else has this whole tax situation affected you to such a
 creative a stronger case for you well for me it's affected me because I am now
 currently home so my situation is a little different they have he has he
 has would you say I'm sorry wait so you said this tax situation kind of you
 think it's the main cause of what made you go homeless yes for yes for me but
 for him the lady that did all of this he's technically in one of his her
 houses and and you didn't eat me okay well oh yes so he's in one of her houses
 because this is in so okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm doing an application
 if you're okay yeah I'm from
 I had a reason what you need well at least you're making steps to take care
 of this because that's important because a lot of people don't see the situation
 and the gravity of this and it seems like you see the gravity in this and it
 seems like it's really important for you to take care of because I mean is it
 is that what you're trying to go for is that a goal that you have in mind to to
 try to fix it so that you could start picking yourself back up yes yes and
 what other goals do you have if you don't mind me asking what once you get this
 whole taxes you resolve yes you do mine is terrible so
 well I'm sorry I'm trying to do the application is well lucky me I feel like
 I said here it does seem like you are doing something to take care of this
 whole situation I'm just kind of curious like what made you want to like step
 up and start taking care of it now I've been wanting to take care of it I just
 haven't had the time to do it I've been wanting to relax whatever it's time to do
 it yeah well it seems like you're doing some stuff now that's that's what I kind
 of wanted to get out here which is good which is good that you're taking care
 of it well let's let's do this then
 um let's in order to see if your expectations are something that we can
 meet what would be the perfect outcome for you like what would be ideal to get
 out of the same way you said what yeah just to see if we could even meet your
 expectations and if we might even be a good fit for you okay we'll be like a
 perfect and the perfect outcome for you for to get this whole with this whole
 tax issue should I just want some we just need our money back so that we can be
 able to and make sure we're able to do our taxes what I have in a problem
 honestly that'd be the best thing for me and him together collectively making
 sure this don't ever happen again and making sure we get the money back that
 is owed to us because he doesn't owe you know we should have to owe anything
 only thinking that we should have owed is that it's something and they took that
 already yeah so why are they still taking his taxes or taxes at all for
 either one of us you know because we haven't in fact it's separate yet we
 haven't yet yet yet so this will be the best time to take care of it when we're
 on it at the same time yeah so you also have unfiled tax years or is that all
 up to date oh no that's all up to date okay that's good okay so so let's take
 care if we're able to even help you reach that and able to get this sorted
 out figure out what's going on and get to help you resolve reduce or even
 eliminate this whole tax issue what would that do for you is what I want to
 know it'll make it easier for me to find taxes next time on the issue it'll actually
 get the stuff off my head about what's going on and what's wrong with with the
 taxes or why is it even you know doing it if you put a piece of mine
 - All right, Jessie, please. - That's great.
 And what has that stress been doing to you lately?
 Well, I don't eat sometimes, most of the time I don't eat, and then if I do, I eat on certain
 things.
 I'm a big old priority, so I cry, I would have a little cry status sometimes, but that's
 true.
 I'll be laughing at me.
 No, no, I'm not laughing.
 I'm not laughing.
 I'm not laughing.
 I'm not laughing.
 I'm talking about my brothers.
 Oh, okay.
 Oh, my sister.
 I'm not laughing.
 I'm not laughing.
 I'm not laughing.
 I'm laughing.
 So, yeah, it's been a lot, actually, like I said, I'm crying calmly, so that is well.
 Yeah.
 I got you.
 Well, Pira, I really enjoyed our conversation.
 I wouldn't want to ruin it with this.
 I really enjoyed it, but like, if I could ask you something else, I don't mean the pride,
 but have you thought about what would happen if you don't do anything to resolve this tax
 issue?
 No, I have it, I mean, I feel like it's just, they just don't keep taking the taxes.
 And what if that were to happen?
 I don't know, I have no idea, like I said, I'm currently homeless, so all I'm doing was
 trying to call in and see what I could get help with.
 I feel like that would keep you in that loop.
 No, I feel like if it was resolved, it would, it would release me and mostly everything that
 I have to have done.
 Yeah.
 I'd like to be said that I owe something or at the time, I found to owe something and
 we have done everything the right way, so for us to be going through what we're going
 through to be held back with our lives like rent and medical things and our kids taking
 closing sometimes, because we were depending on that to come through, like, in our rent
 ahead of time, stuff like that, it was just a lot that it had put us through because thinking
 that our money was coming at one point and putting stuff together to be able to be like,
 "Well, we used a little bit to save it, so we learned it because the fact comes, that
 is the problem, it didn't come."
 Yeah.
 That's something I don't want to have to go through again.
 So it's important for you to solve this tax issue, and you say this.
 Yes, because every day, every year, it gets higher and on top of that, they don't give
 us anything.
 Yeah.
 In fact, we're working for nothing.
 Of course.
 Well, based on what you told me, Tara, it does look like what we're doing here might
 actually work for you, and so what I could do with your permission, of course, is I want
 to go over what we do here, how our process works to resolve the tax issues, and it will
 look like once we get down to this and resolve this whole issue.
 Would that be appropriate?
 Okay.
 Yes.
 So, Tara, you know how your venture to me that you have about maybe $20, $30,000 in
 tax that maybe which has been causing you some stress, and you not being able to get your
 tax return and file taxes and all that stuff?
 Yes.
 Well, here's how we could help you.
 So, our plan of action of taking care of this has two phases.
 So, the first phase that we have to get into is called the investigation.
 So, what happens here is in this first phase, our licensed professionals, they'll get into
 your whole entire tax issue, they'll gather and dissect each year of your tax that balances
 the tax return and the wage and income records all directly from the IRS.
 So, we will pretty much have a big whole understanding of what exactly is going on with
 your entire tax issue from head to toe.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Now, before I explain phase two, did everything make sense to you so far?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Do you have any questions about this phase?
 No.
 Okay.
 So, once we get done with phase one, that's when we get into phase two, which is called
 the resolution.
 So, we'll use the information that we gathered from the investigation, and then we'll create
 a plan on what programs that I mentioned earlier we used to resolve the tax debt.
 So, once we finish the resolution, here are some things that can happen for you.
 So, you could be put on a very affordable payment plan with the IRS after the negotiations
 to whatever is left.
 So, you could have up to 100% of your tax debt reduced or eliminated.
 You'll also be compliant with the IRS, which would mean that you're caught up and up to
 date and safe from any further actions like levies, wage garnishments, or any type of action
 that they like to take against you, like taking money into your account or whatever it is.
 You can say that, but most importantly, you'll be able to have that peace of mind and get
 this whole thing taken care of and have a whole team of professionals guiding you throughout
 the whole process, letting you know what you should do so you could get that peace of
 mind, resolve this whole tax issue, and then start making moves of getting back on your
 feet.
 Now, do you have any questions about this phase?
 No.
 Okay.
 And do you feel like this is something that would help you?
 Yes.
 And how do you see this helping you the most?
 So the biggest thing is just getting the tax problem resolved to figure out what was the
 issue.
 And where the amount of stuff came from, so I think that it helped me a lot just knowing
 that I'm figuring out basically the overall problem of what happened with this situation.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 And that's how you see this helping you the most out of everything?
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 So I just want to, like I said, take my stuff out and I'll go to this to help me get on
 my feet more just knowing that that's figured out.
 So next time I do some around without taxes, I'll have no problem.
 Yeah.
 Of course.
 Well, to get started on all this, we'll dig into your tax situation with the IRS and
 resolving your tax debt.
 We will need a retainer fee of $595 to start on this investigation, which we will also
 apply to the resolution fee on our second phone call.
 Okay.
 Now.
 Okay.
 So I have to talk to the other person is on there and she will come up with by Monday.
 If that could happen, but like I said, it's before I am currently homeless and I am currently
 looking for a job.
 So I asked that after running that past family motorbike, so you'll pay for it.
 Oh, yeah.
 Of course.
 I hear you.
 Oh, yeah.
 I hear you.
 I'm here.
 Don't get wrong.
 I do believe me.
 I do.
 And, but at the end of the day, like this, if you put money aside, do you feel like this
 is what would help you get out of this whole situation?
 Yeah.
 I think it's one time put once you put our heads together, I think that'll be perfectly
 dry.
 I don't think you have an issue with that.
 I just think at this time, we can currently give $500 some dollars that we really don't
 have to get.
 Especially me.
 I don't have that.
 If anything, he does.
 He's the one with the consistent job, but he does also have my kids, my three older kids.
 So, yeah, that is part of the fact too, so.
 Yeah, of course, of course.
 And well, can I suggest something?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 How about we finish up the process so that at least we could get you on track to resolving
 your tax issue?
 And then when it gets down to the payment and all that, how we're going to do that,
 I could help you out the same way and help all my other clients.
 You could split it up, schedule it out, make it affordable for you.
 Would that help you?
 Okay.
 That'd be perfect.
 Okay.
 So, let me address you the same way that IRS would.
 I have your first name as Tierra.
 Mm-hmm.
 Okay.
 And that's P-I-A-R-R.
 Okay, and that's P-I-A-R-R, I'm sorry.
 Tierra sounds like I like you.
 No, yeah, I think I'll ask you a little bit.
 Okay.
 You said you were asking a question?
 Well, not for you, it was for my sister.
 Okay, for sure.
 So, it's I-E-R-R-I-A, right?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 And then for your middle, do you have a middle knee?
 Middle initial?

 She, first she went this way, said her.
 Then she went this way, "Let's keep writing my damn eyes."
 I'm not saying what's going on.

 Because I'm going to call him a little right after I get off the phone with you,
 but I would like him to hear from you as well.
 >> Of course.
 And if you could even add us in a threw-away call and be more than happy to address anything
 as well.

 He said he cannot do that right now.
 >> Yeah, of course.
 >> Okay, no problem.
 I'm going to do that.
 But what I could do here now is I could set up the -- get the document signed so we could
 at least start working on it.
 >> Yeah.
 >> So here's what we'll do.
 So it's the third right now.
 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to push for like two weeks out for the first half of it.
 >> Okay.
 >> So that would be on the 17th.
 >> Okay.
 >> And then the next one will be on the 31st, so it'll give you a whole month's time.
 Also, you two should be getting seven-day reminders as well as three-day reminders.
 So if anything ever comes up and you can't make it for some reason with any of the payments,
 you could just get in contact with me and I'll make adjustments accordingly.
 >> Okay.
 >> Yeah, this is --
 >> Yeah.
 This is just so my professionals could get started on your case and start working on something.
 So that way if something happens again, they could attempt to protect you during this process
 as well.
 >> Thank you.
 >> Yeah, no problem.
 And then as for the card on file, it's not going to charge you anything right now.
 Is it going to be a credit or debit card?
 >> One second because I don't have enough in on me right now.

 Yeah. Okay, it is. Have you, have you used it at all? And it's okay because it's locked right now. I just might have to put it in manually. So you might have to give me a second here. Is that okay?
 That's fine. Okay. Give me one sec.
 Did we do the application for this?
 I wasn't able to imagine. Oh, yeah. We did on the robot. Thanks. We got it.
 I'm going to go ahead and pause this phone.
 I should point out my whole, like, why would you do that? That was a dumb.
 All the people know about my whole. Yeah. But I'm just, yeah, it's okay. We're not running a payment today. I just want to let you know. It's not a big deal. But before the payment does come up, you're going to have to probably unlock the card.
 Oh, it's frozen. Okay. I got it. Yeah. It is frozen.
 Okay. Well, today's fine. Today's fine. We're not worried about today. I just want you to have the understanding. Yeah, just why I'm having to do it manually because of all that. Yeah.
 Okay. Yeah. So what are you and sister doing right now? You're like, I started getting McDonald's or something like that. I thought I heard like McDonald's or something. I don't know.
 Yeah. We're trying. We're doing job application. Oh, job applications. Okay. That's good. What are you guys applying to?
 We did make that. We're doing McDonald's. We did. Oh, I didn't hear about that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You did. Yeah.
 I'm going to get me some fries while you're at it too. That's just kidding. Yeah. I'm just kidding. I'm messing with you. Yeah.
 Yeah. No, but what were you saying? No, I say you're fine. I'm just waiting my turn to the interview. So.
 Okay. Yeah. No problem. Oh, you're going to do an interview? Yes. Okay. Yeah. We're almost done. Yeah.
 Yeah. I do know that McDonald's just have a lot of growth opportunities as well. So that'd be good.
 Yes. Yeah. And then I think we have a lot of benefits too. Like I think we got like 401K maybe and like medical and dental as well.
 Today's Thursday. So we could do it. Okay. Cool. Okay. So the manager.
 My manager just finished that. So you're going to be getting the first text message right now. From 9.4.9.3.9.0. 5.6.6.8.3.
 Okay. Then they do I need to say something to you about it or something or what?
 Yeah. If you received it, let me know if you received it. It's the document spending that we signed. Yeah. Oh, I just have to find them.
 Yeah. It's going to be everything that we've discussed as well as the schedule that we have for the payment.
 And I'll come through the set. Yes. Right. Okay. Yeah. Just let me know when you received them.
 Yeah. Nothing fucked up. Yeah. So nothing popped up. Not your email.
 My email. Yeah. My email email. If not, I'll go ahead and send it again.
 It should be under the link that says e-sign API.
 I'm going to say again because I don't see anything.
 Yeah, I should say e-sign. I'm going to send it one more time.
 It should be sending through our 9.4.9 number. So it'll be.
 I see right here. Yeah. Okay. There you go. So yeah, you would just open that up and then they'll take you to a.
 Clear Start Tax Relief E-signature.
 You see the page? This is Clear Start Tax E-signature.
 I'm hitting authorized. It's not doing it. Okay. Did you write your last name? Yeah, it says it's good.
 And then the birthday is it good as well? It's not. It's red. I don't know why. Okay.
 So you'd have to do it with no spaces, no slashes, no dashes and it will be just the numbers. It'll be 04.09.
 Yes, I did. Try erasing it again. I got it right here.
 Okay. Yeah.
 Yeah. So yeah.
 Does that have 04.09.197? Is that what you have as well?
 Yeah, I'm finding them now. Okay. Sounds good.
 And then yeah, when you sign your name, make sure it's your first and last name and to print it as well as.
 I did it. I did my first name and my last name are too long. So I just hit JT.
 Okay. We would need if not, what about your signature that you do for your driver's license? That would work as well.
 That's the one I do for my driver's license too long. Okay. That's perfect.
 Well, actually, I did actually this driver's license. I did it. I did the full name, which you did.
 So do I have to start over? Okay.
 Yeah. If it's like up to date, because it might get rejected since, you know, we are dealing with the IRS and stuff like that.
 They're really strict on when it comes to everything with the timing.
 You have to restart the reason that again, so it's not letting me start over.
 Okay. Did you submit it already? Is that what happened?
 I'm not sure. Hold on. Okay.
 If anything, I could, I could resend it. Just check if it submitted or no. Yeah.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 My name is way too long for this. Yeah, I got to.
 Well, so how do you do it for your driver's license, the signature, the same signature that you have for your driver's license will be perfect.
 Well, I have to use my full name on this one. I don't know why, but it's not going to look great. So I'm not sure that it's going to be a problem.
 Well, no, no, as long as it's the same as your driver's license, then that should be fine.
 I can't fit all my name in here, so I'm saying.
 Oh, that's how you write it in your driver's license. You write your full name?
 Yes. So I can't fit. I can't fit it in this box. That's what I'm saying. Give me. Give me one. One sec. Let me.
 Let me talk to a manager. See what I could do about that. One sec. Okay. Yeah.
 Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Just hold for a couple of seconds. Give me one second.
 Okay. Okay. Thank you.
 I'm right here with my manager.
 When you say your driver's license, are you doing your whole name in cursive?
 I don't know how to write in cursive.
 Your mind is a little bit right in cursive.
 It's just printed, but their system is small, and I have a pen on my phone.
 You guys just think it's not long enough for my full name.
 So you could do it like a print or such a J in the C and write my first name out.
 So what you could do is put your first name and then the second part of your last name.
 That's what a manager's saying you could do.
 So just put Calvin instead of some of his.
 Yes, so just here are Calvin's will be fine.
 So here are Calvin's.
 Yes, correct.
 Print that and just make sure it's clear and concise that way it's legible and everything
 is able to write as well.
 If you guys want that, you guys need to have a pen or someone here because that's not going
 to happen with my hand writing in this small box.
 Yeah, you could turn your phone sideways.
 He could turn your phone sideways to that back health, maybe.
 I know I would send you a pen to try with, but it's just, you know, I.
 There you go.
 Okay, and then you just have to do it with all of the yellow bubbles that they find here.
 And yeah, that's the easy part.
 And then once you get done with that, then okay.
 So you can look on top of the favorite.
 You should got it, you know, because I can't hear my word from it.
 Okay, I got it.
 Thank you.
 Sounds good.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 And then I will also send you the spouse's documents as well.
 And then I will just need those back as well.
 So I'm going.
 Go ahead and send those.
 Okay.
 Am I able to fill it out like on the website or am I going to have to print them out?
 No, yeah.
 So I sent them over to you.
 I was just, you could just send them back.
 That's fine.
 Just let me know if you received them.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Never from the knowledge.
 Um, I tried to do it, it said I tried to put my name in, and my date of birth, and instead
 of red, so it's not taking it, I guess.
 Um, you put it for the husband, um, for the self.
 Oh, not that Johnny's.
 Okay.
 That's why I didn't work in half.
 Yeah.
 We need the last name, and then yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 There we go.
 Oops.
 Okay.
 You put IE for Johnny, right?
 Oh, why is that IE on his, yeah, on his IDs, IE A O H N and IE.
 Yeah.
 And that's what I put it here and it's not taking me, so I guess I always do that.
 Give me one sec.
 I'll send them one more time.
 Um, okay, I'm sending them over.
 You should be getting them.
 Okay.
 Let me know when you received them.
 Yeah, um, it's not working.
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Um, so, so he's, he's here taking that, his name is not.
 Is it the last name that's only or is it the whole nine?
 It was just need to be the last name.
 Yup.
 I see.
 Okay.
 Give me one sec.
 I got it.
 Oh, it went in?
 Yes.
 Do I just type, do I just write his name out the thing?
 Yeah, exactly.
 So we would just need the first and last name for, for your stuff.
 Did it say submit it as well because I haven't received any of the, oh, yeah, you know what,
 they received them being one sec.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 These look good.
 I'm looking over them.
 Okay.
 And then for.
 She's taking a break.
 No, I'm not even going to worry about it.
 Okay.
 Sounds good.
 So I have all those documents here.
 Okay.
 Everything looks good on, on my end.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 Yeah.
 So just to summarize what you should expect moving forward.
 First, we'll investigate your tax issue with the IRS.
 We will find out all the years you owe taxes on the exact amount of each year and your
 current status with the IRS.
 Once the investigation is done, I will personally call you back seven to 14 days.
 Once everything's paid in full to discuss the next phase, which is the resolution, we
 will have a concrete plan on how to resolve, produce, or eliminate your tax issue.
 Now, do you have any questions of it right now?
 No.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 So I do need you to save our company number on your phone so we could go ahead and do
 me that favor.

 Thank you.
 Okay.
 And then this is time sensitive.
 So if me and my client care team reach out to you, make sure to respond as soon as possible,
 please.
 And I will also go over and reach out with the resolution plan seven to 14 days.
 Once the investigation is completed complete and paid in full.
 And then just setting realistic expectations.
 There will be a second fee for the resolution, depending on what you get qualified for and
 how complicated your cases.
 I will also credit the investigation to your resolution as well.
 Other than that, I'm glad I could help you.
 Did you have any other questions before we end the call?
 No.

 Okay.
 All right, then.
